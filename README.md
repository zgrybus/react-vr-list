# About project

:boom: Useful **hook** for efficiently rendering large lists:boom:

### Why another virtual-list library?

Despite that there are a lot of virtual-list libraries, I decided to create another one. I used to work with [react-window](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-window), [react-virtualized](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized) and [react-virtual](https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-virtual).

**Neither of them, supports "unknown" row height and nested list virtualization**. Furthermore, some of them are either not being developed anymore or their API is quite complicated to me. Moreover, they are not written in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
